# Mohamed Hisham | Cybersecurity Student 🔐

## 👋 About Me
I am a **Cybersecurity student** currently focusing on **Web Penetration Testing** and offensive security fundamentals.  
I believe in learning security the practical way, so most of my progress comes from **hands-on labs, real attack scenarios, and CTF-style challenges**.

طالب سايبر سيكيورتي، مركز بشكل أساسي على **اختبار اختراق تطبيقات الويب**، وبطوّر نفسي عمليًا من خلال التجربة المباشرة مش الحفظ النظري.
